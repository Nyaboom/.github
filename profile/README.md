## Hi there 👋

💣 We are Nyaboom, a collective of people dedicated to exploding.

💰 Our #1 sponsor is the Groovy foundation, dedicated to helping people move away from Java and switch to the almighty Groovy.

🌈 If you want to contribute then do, we just make insane things for some reason.

🍿 For breakfast, we eat nothing because idk.
