## Hi there 👋

We are Nyaboom, a collective of people dedicated to exploding.

Our #1 sponsor is the Kotlin foundation, dedicated to helping people move away from Java and switch to the almighty Kotlin.

Anyway since I'm lazy to actually write something good take this and pretend it's good

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
